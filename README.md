# *TilGenPro*: an automated Python-based pipeline for tiles generation and pre-processing 

## What is TilGenPro?
TilGenPro is an automated Python-based pipeline that, starting from a QuPath project of annotated whole slide images (WSIs), generates 512x512 pixel edge length square patches (tiles) from the annotated tumor area, filters out those characterized by a high amount of background, and stain normalize the tiles passing the filter using the Macenko method [1].

![Figure 1](figures/Figure1.png)

**Figure 1. Overview of *TilGenPro* workflow.** The annotated tumor area (red) within each slide belonging to the QuPath project (1) is tessellated into smaller tiles (patches) (2). Tiles first undergo a quality-filtering step basing on their log10-transformed median intensity values distribution (3) and afterwards are stain normalized (4).

More detailed information on how the quality-filtering step is implemented can be found in the pre-print version of our manuscript **[(here)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.14.23291350v1)**.

## Software requirements and setup
TiGenPro has been implemented and tested to run on a remote server based on Ubuntu's 20.04.4 long-term support (LTS) operating system using QuPath v.0.2.3 and Python v.3.7.12. In order to be run, the following packages are required:

+ qupath [(from the svillal channel)](https://github.com/bayer-science-for-a-better-life/qupath-feedstock)
+ python
+ numpy
+ pandas
+ matplotlib
+ pillow
+ tqdm

To get started, clone the GitHub repository through the command:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/MiriamAng/TilGenPro.git
````

We suggest to run the pipeline in a dedicated conda environment. This can be built through the provided yml file as follows:
``` bash
# Crete the conda environment tilGenProEnv
conda env create -f /path/to/TilGenPro/envFile.yml

# Activate the conda environment
conda activate tilGenProEnv
````
## How to run the pipeline?
### Default configuration settings
Once the GitHub repository has been cloned, the easiest way to run the pipeline is:
1) to navigate to the directory containing the script **tilesPreprocessing.py**
2) to run the script **tilesPreprocessing.py** by specifying the absolute path to the QuPath project file
``` bash
# Navigate to the directory containing the script tilesPreprocessing.py
cd path/to/TilGenPro/src

# Run the script tilesPreprocessing.py
python tilesPreprocessing.py path/to/qupath_proj_folder/project_name.qpproj
````
In this way, all the WSIs belonging to the QuPath project will be processed and the following folder's organization will be used to store the output of the pipeline:

![Figure 2](figures/Figure2.png)

By default, two new folders will be created in the same directory as the QuPath project, namely *tiles* and *results*.

+ *tiles*: contains as many subfolders as the number of WSIs processed. Each subfolder, in turn, stores all the tiles (jpeg format) generated from the respective annotated tumor area
+ *results*: contains the output of the pre-processing procedure
     + *preprocessingRes*: stores the results from filtering and stain-normalization
          + *normTiles*: contains, for a given WSI 
            + the histogram of the log10-transformed median intensity values distribution with the thresholds used for filtering highlighted in black
            + a pickle file storing a python dictionary where keys represent tile names and values the associated pixel intensities in the form of a numpy array
            + a log file storing the main information from tiles generation and filtering
          + *discTiles*: stores all the tiles (jpeg format) that did not pass the qualily-filtering step and were therefore discarded
     + *infoWSIs.csv*: stores information on the number of tiles generated for a given WSI (column 'numTilesInit') and of the tiles kept after the quality-filtering step (column 'numTilesAfterPreproc') stores all the tiles (jpeg format) that did not pass the qualily-filtering step.

## Customized configuration settings
The pipeline also allows for optional arguments according to user-specific requirements. 

| Optional Argument | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --groovyScript | ./TilGenPro/src/generateTiles.groovy | absolute path to the groovy script (.groovy) used for tiles generation |
| --shellScript | ./TilGenPro/src/runQupath.sh |  absolute path to the shell script (.sh) script used to run QuPath from terminal |
| --tilesDir  | QuPath project directory | absolute path to the directory where the tiles generated will be stored |
| --outputDir | QuPath project directory |  absolute path to the directory where the results from pre-processing will be stored |
| --wsiDir | None | absolute path to the folder containing the dataframe storing information on the WSIs to process |
| --jpgNormTiles | False | Save the normalized tiles in JPG other than as a pickle file |
| --wsiList | None | list of the full name(s) of the WSIs to process |
| --lowerPerc | 10 | percentile correspondent to the dark threshold on the log10-transformed median intesity pixel values distribution for a given WSI |
| --upperPerc | 90 | percentile correspondent to the white threshold on the log10-transformed median intesity pixel values distribution for a given WSI |  

The help documentation is easly accessible through the following command:
``` bash
python tilesPreprocessing.py --help
````
Notably, in case there is the need to process only a subset of the WSIs belonging to the QuPath project, these can be provided in input in two different ways:

1) by providing through the optional argument *--wsiDir* the absolute path to a folder containing a file called *slidesToProcess.csv* built by the user. 

**NOTE!** The file **has to** be called slidesToProcess.csv. It can contain as many column as wanted but it **must** contain at least a column called 'Slide' where are stored, in each row, the full names (e.g. wsi_name.mrxs) of the WSIs to process.

``` bash
python tilesPreprocessing.py path/to/qupath_proj_folder/project_name.qpproj --wsiDir path/to/data_frame
````

#### slidesToProcess.csv - Example 1

| **Slide** | 
| --- | 
| wsi1.mrxs | 
| wsi2.mrxs | 
| ... |
| wsiN.mrxs |

#### slidesToProcess.csv - Example 2

| **Slide** | X | Y | Z | ... | ... |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| wsi1.mrxs | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| wsi2.mrxs | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| wsiN.mrxs | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

#### slidesToProcess.csv - Example 3

| ... | X | Y | Z | ... |  **Slide** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |  wsi1.mrxs |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | wsi2.mrxs |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | wsiN.mrxs |

2) by specifying WSI(s) full name(s) (e.g. wsi_name.mrxs) through the optional argument *--wsiList*. If two or more WSIs are provided in input, their full names need to be separated by a space. 

**NOTE!** We recommend using the optional argument --wsiList only in case of a limited number of WSIs to process (e.g. 5)
``` bash
python tilesPreprocessing.py path/to/qupath_proj_folder/project_name.qpproj --wsiList wsi1.mrxs wsi2.mrxs
````
Finally, if the optional argument *--jpgNormTiles* is provided, all the normalized tiles belonging to a given WSI will be saved in JPG under the same folder path containing the normalization results.
